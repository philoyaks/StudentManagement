# StudentManagement System

Welcome to this repo,
This project, was basically to show majorly CRUD implementations of a student database system consisting of several students data and information depending on their various classes. I made use of Asp.net core for its backend and API, and  used Flutter for building the mobile app

This project contains 4 different folder, which basically implements the same features all through

**1. Web view**

It was implemented using two different approach, The MVC dotnet architecture and Razor pages:
Made use of SQL , as its database for implementation.

**2. Mobile App**

- Flutter
- Consumed the API I created using DIO Package, to also implement same feature.
- I'm not a designer, but for fun, I also designed the Mobile app UI on Figma before starting the build [`click here`](https://www.figma.com/file/d7Mx1MdyY37jx9g9zamZmU/Student-Management-App?node-id=0%3A1)
